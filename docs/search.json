Currently I am a Master of Science candidate in Urban Spatial Science Program in University College London. In my undergaduate, I studied architecture in a four-year program at Institute Technology Bandung.\nMy interest are related to socio-spatial analysis, spatial data visualisation, and informal settlement mapping. Along with 2 other friends, I built an urban data centre platrform for my hometown, Surabaya, called Suroboyo Ngalor Ngidul. This platform aims to collect and spread data about Surabaya, especially in urban mobilities, social, and economy."
