Currently I am a Master of Science candidate in Urban Spatial Science Program in University College London. In my undergaduate, I studied architecture in a four-year program at Institute Technology Bandung.\nMy interest are related to socio-spatial analysis, spatial data visualisation, and informal settlement mapping. Along with 2 other friends, I built an urban data centre platrform for my hometown, Surabaya, called Suroboyo Ngalor Ngidul. This platform aims to collect and spread data about Surabaya, especially in urban mobilities, social, and economy."

    "section": "1.2 Application",
    "text": "1.2 Application\nThe increasing satellite remote sensing data on earth observation in the last two decades, allows new approaches on understanding urban setting (Miller and Small, 2003). Satellite remote sensing data offers some advantages, such as: - broader spatial coverage, - ability for routine update, - consistent measurement\nCombination of remote sensing data with census data or other government data can provide us useful information such as, urban growth, urban heat island, and socioeconomic activities. We will discuss some application examples of remote sensing data, classified based on sensor type.\n\n1.2.1 Active Sensor\n\n1.2.1.1 Population Size estimation using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)\nDifferent from passive sensor, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is an active sensor that can see through cloud and the backscatter radar wave can determine physical properties such as density and surface texture (Henderson and Zong-Guo Xia, 1997). The ability of SAR to detect horizontal and vertical structure allows to detect settlement based on texture, materials geometry and density. The result of settlement detection can be used for estimating city population by multiplying with number of occupants per dwelling. Harris (1985) used this methods for estimating population in Tunisia.\nThis methods is beneficial for developing countries because they have more informal types of dwellings. Radar Data is really helpful because population census happens only once in 10 years (Henderson and Zong-Guo Xia, 1997) which could not keep up the rapid urban growth.\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Passive Sensor\n\n1.2.2.1 Evaluating Poverty using Nighttime Light (NTL) Satellite\nNighttime Light Satellite is a passive sensor launched by nasa to collect data of night light emission (Earth Science Data Systems, 2021). The data from this satellite provide unique perspective that can be beneficial for detecting global conflict, human night behaviour, ecological impact of artificial night light and so on.\nOne of the benefit of nighttime light data is to track socioeconomic inequality and poverty. Yu (2015) evaluated poverty rate in 2856 counties in china. The research compare the average light index from Visible Infrared day-night band with integrated poverty index. It used linear regression and comparison of class to check how accurate the remote sensing data to evaluate poverty. The result shows that day-night band data can be useful to evaluate poverty in china"

    "text": "1.3 Reflection\n\nThe increase of remote sensing data on earth observation helps researcher, policy makers, and local government to understand the urban context better. Special characteristic of remote sensing data allows us to have broader perspectives and collect spatial improvement from time to time which could not be provided by tradisional population census data.\nIn the application we can combine the remote sensing data with census data to have more robust analysis.\nAlthough, using remote sensing data looks more fancy, in some cases and context we can get the similar data that are more efficient and cost effective from governmental source [miller_cities_2003]. For example we can use building permission data rather than satellite data to identify land use.\nMoreover, managing remote sensing data require higher skill than traditional data. It can be an obstacle for cities that has limited resources\n\n\n\n\n\nEarth Science Data Systems, N. (2021) “Nighttime Lights,” Earthdata.
