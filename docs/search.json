Currently I am a Master of Science candidate in Urban Spatial Science Program in University College London. In my undergaduate, I studied architecture in a four-year program at Institute Technology Bandung.\nMy interest are related to socio-spatial analysis, spatial data visualisation, and informal settlement mapping. Along with 2 other friends, I built an urban data centre platrform for my hometown, Surabaya, called Suroboyo Ngalor Ngidul. This platform aims to collect and spread data about Surabaya, especially in urban mobilities, social, and economy."

It can be done by mapping potential natural disaster based on previous flooding and clustering map. Making flooding map can be gained by regressing SAR flooding area data, rainfall data, sea level data (from satellite data), and topography data from Shuttle Radar Mission DEM (citation). To make Landslide map we can comparing historic topography data from Shuttle Radar Mission DEM which movement of geological structure (citation). Combining these 2 maps, Semarang government will can have natural disaster risk map that can be guideline for city planning to focus on areas with high risk.\nNatural disaster can cause some residential areas be isolated. Thus, emergency access are required for massive evacuation and supply daily needs which also the indicator in goals number 9 in City Resilience Index. City government need to map crucial acces and alternative acces on disaster. In order to do that, mapping or clustered residential area are required which can be obtain from classifying landsat imagery data using NDBI. By assessing residential map dan natural disaster risk map, government can make crucial emergency transportation plan. It also can be enhance with agent-based modelling to simulate evacuation and basic needs supply. Hence, government can focusing their policy and city planning in building or improving emergency transportation access.\nInternational policy help local government, that sometimes does not have a robust policy, to build and develop a resilience city. In order to achieve International policy’s target, earth observation data can be a helpful resources for decision making and city planning. Satellite imagery data allows government to have macro and micro scale observation of their historic or existing city condition. It can be beneficial to detect existing urban fabrics and potential urban network. Imagery data are also beneficial to record pre-during-post condition of an event or disaster. Thus in the future local government can prevent or protect their citizen better especially for city with periodic disaster like Semarang or Greater Dhaka (Dewan et al., 2007). Remote Sensing data allows Semarang government to achieve not only one but five indicators of ARUP City Resilience Index."
